Description: The androgen receptor is a member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand activated transcription factors. These receptors bind to steroid hormones, thyroid hormone, retinoids and vitamin D among others, dimerize and bind to DNA. Its ligands include testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione. Stimulation of the receptor activates the SMAD signaling module. Source: http://www.netpath.org/pathways?path_id=NetPath_2
