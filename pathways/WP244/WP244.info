Description: "Integrins are cell surface heterodimeric protein complex consisting of one alpha and one beta chain. Integrins act as cell adhesion molecules as well as participate in cellular signaling. The ligands of the alpha6 beta4 integrin are heterotrimers belonging to the laminin family including Laminin A2, Laminin B1, Laminin C1, Laminin A3, Laminin B3, Laminin C2, Laminin A5, Laminin A1 and Laminin B2 among others. Upon activation, the receptor is phosphorylated and associates with adaptor molecules Shc and Grb2, which then activate the PI 3-kinase/Akt, MAPK/NFkB and SMAD signaling modules."

It is strongly expressed on basal keratinocytes, in which it is concentrated in specialized adhesion structures called hemidesmosomes. Abnormal expression of the integrin alpha6-beta4 in the suprabasal cell layers has been associated with an increased malignancy of squamous cell carcinomas. The continued expression of alpha6-beta4, when cells leave the basement membrane and migrate into the upper layers, may contribute to a reduced dependence of growth on anchorage and thus to an increased cell proliferation. Recent studies have identified the alpha6-beta4 integrin as a sigalling molecule that rates proliferation in response to the interaction of cells with Iaminin." Source: Dr. A.
