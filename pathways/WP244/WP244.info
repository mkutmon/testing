Description: "The integrin alpha6-beta4 is a receptor for various Iaminin isofoms. It is strongly expressed on basal keratinocytes, in which it is concentrated in specialized adhesion structures called hemidesmosomes. Abnormal expression of the integrin alpha6-beta4 in the suprabasal cell layers has been associated with an increased malignancy of squamous cell carcinomas. The continued expression of alpha6-beta4, when cells leave the basement membrane and migrate into the upper layers, may contribute to a reduced dependence of growth on anchorage and thus to an increased cell proliferation. Recent studies have identified the alpha6-beta4 integrin as a sigalling molecule that rates proliferation in response to the interaction of cells with Iaminin." Source: Dr. A.
