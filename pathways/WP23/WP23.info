Description: The B cell receptor includes membrane Î¼ heavy chain molecules bound to a light chain and an Ig alpha (CD79A)/Ig beta (CD79B) heterodimer. Activation of the B cell receptor involves phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) present in Ig alpha and beta. This leads to activation of several non-receptor tyrosine kinases including those of the Src, Tec and Syk family of kinases. Downstream messengers include DAG, IP3, MAPK/ERK and JNK signaling modules.  Source: NetPath http://www.netpath.org/pathways?path_id=NetPath_12
